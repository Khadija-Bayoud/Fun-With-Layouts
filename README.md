  ### About the homework
  <p>
    Qt includes a set of layout management classes that are used to describe how widgets are laid out in an application's user interface. These layouts automatically position and     resize widgets when the amount of space available for them changes, ensuring that they are consistently arranged and that the user interface as a whole remains usable.
